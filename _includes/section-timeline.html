<h3 class = "blue" id = "discover">discover</h3>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At Entropy, we believe in connecting our clients with our network of top students, carefully curated from a diverse range of world-class universities. Through exploration in the form of face to face meetings with students in our network, you will discover possibilities and obtain a great deal of information.<br> 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alongside these personal, one to one communications with students, our counseling team will provide you with access to our organization’s meticulously managed database of resources, guides, tips, and tricks, as well as local and international connections and opportunities for rich and specific extracurricular involvement.</p>
<h3 class = "blue" id = "design">design</h3>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With this framework of information, our clients are prepared to tackle the task of designing their approach to college admissions. Oftentimes, we find that students have a “dream school” or “dream program” in mind, and they model their college lists, extracurriculars, and essays for that school. However, at ENTROPY, we believe that every great plan starts with a clear goal, and so it is imperative that we develop that goal.</p>
<h3 class = "blue" id = "dream">dream</h3>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Through guided inquiry, our team and client work together to deconstruct that dream and find the core idea that captivates our client about a certain career path, university, or discipline. We believe a “dream university” without a dream is just a university, and neither us nor our clients are willing to settle for “just a university”.  When our students have the opportunity to explore diverse possibilities and design their dream for themselves, the path ahead becomes straightforward to <em>determine.</em></p>

<h3 class = "blue" id = "determine">determine</h3>

<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the final stage of our service, we pride ourselves on ensuring our clients are certain about what they have to do and when they have to do it by utilizing our understanding of mechanisms that operate behind the scenes of the college admission process.
<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For instance, admission officers seek to build the future student body of their university through searching for specific student profiles, which has birthed a stigma in university counseling circles that misleads many students into building an artificial application to get into a top university.  At ENTROPY,  we believe in leading our clients to grow to their utmost potential and finding universities that are looking for those qualities; we start by investigating the best universities for our clients, therefore naturally mirroring our student’s overarching narrative with various forms of these archetypes, greatly increasing the likelihood of successful admissions and scholarships. 
<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a constructive process inspired by Agile project development methodology, we continously develop and iterate on our client's application packages -- through critical feedback, drafting, and brainstorming, we work overtime to ensure that when our client is looked at holistically, they understand their DREAM.</p></div>
