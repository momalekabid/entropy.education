<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">
 <em>What if you could have a conversation with yourself in a few years? </em>
 <br><br>
 The <b>entropy</b> -- the disorder or <em>uncertainty</em>, of your college admissions journey would be eliminated.
 <br> You’d know exactly what, how, where, and why you’re studying what (future) you is studying. You could truly understand where <b>you</b> want to be.
 <br><br>
 Fortunately, the next best thing after your future self is here, at your fingertips:
 <br> Someone who was you in the (not so distant) past: a student, not a counselor.
We have found that many students will sum up the college admission process as follows:
<br><br>
            <em>Entirely</em> <b>CONFUSING</b> <br> and <br> <em> Unnecessarily</em> <b>COMPETITIVE</b>
<br><br>
By providing our clients with the right information,
<br> and guiding them with our proven frameworks, we can eliminate both: <br>
<s>CONFUSION</s><br> and <br><s>COMPETITION</s> <br>
<br>
