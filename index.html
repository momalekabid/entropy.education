<em>What if you could have a conversation with yourself in a few years? </em>

<br>You could truly understand where <b>you</b> want to be.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the next best thing after your future self is here, at your fingertips:
<br>Someone who was you in the past: not just a counselor, but a <em>student</em>.

<p class = "subtitle">Mohamed Abid</p>
<p> My name is Mohamed Abid, and I'm a junior studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Waterloo. I graduated as the valedictorian of the American School of Dubai's Class of 2020.
During my personal experience applying to the US, Canada, and UK for Computer Science, I interviewed at the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London, receiving offers from Imperial College London, Warwick, Leeds, and UCL. In the US, I received a significant research scholarship from USC, and in Canada I was offered a full ride to McGill as well as substantial scholarships to the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo.
Our vision for this firm has always been a bold contrast to the inflexible and pricey programs of many private education and counselling firms. </p>

<p class = "subtitle">Abdullah Khurram</p>
<p>My name is Muhammad Abdullah Khurram, and I am studying Economics and Computer Science at Stanford. I have been exposed to many aspects of the college admissions process, going through it myself back in 2020, and helping countless others apply during and after that time. Being passionate about, and putting a big emphasis on quality writing, I always spend quite a lot of effort on helping others craft the best essays possible. I am very interested in philosophy, science, tech and social justice, and am eager to talk to others about their passions, in the process of translating them as best we can into words on paper. Having applied and gotten substantial financial aid from colleges like, Stanford, Yale and Cornell, I am also very well versed in the financial aid process, especially from the perspective of an international student. I am excited to join you on your journey towards your dream college.</p>
<img src="/assets/img/senan.png" alt="Senan">
<p class = "subtitle">Senan Khawaja</p>
<p>My name is Senan Khawaja, I am a junior at Stanford University studying Economics and International Relations. Iâ€™ve lived all around the world including the Middle East, Europe, Asia and now North America. I am passionate about pursuing a career in international development. At Stanford, I am the CFO of BASES, the largest entrepreneurship club at the university, and a member of the Rugby team. 
<br>
I received offers from the London School of Economics, the University of Toronto Rotman School of Business and I interviewed at Oxford for History and Politics. In the past two years I have help clients achieve admissions at top Ivy League schools, as well as Oxbridge and competitive universities in Canada and Europe. My vision for Entropy is to create a good faith environment where each client is able to reach their utmost potential.</p>
